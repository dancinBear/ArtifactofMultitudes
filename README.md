# ArtifactofMultitudes
A mod for Risk of Rain 2 inspired by wildbook's <a href="https://thunderstore.io/package/wildbook/Multitudes/">Multitudes</a>, and written with the aid of EvanTich's <a href="https://github.com/EvanTich/ror2-modding/tree/master/ExampleArtifact">example artifact project</a>.

This mod adds an artifact that causes the game to scale faster, but spawn more loot and interactibles. It does this by scaling the game for an additional player whenever a teleporter event is completed.
It should be noted that when used in conjunction with Multitudes, the effect is multiplicative - If Multitudes is scaling your game for 4 players, then the first stage will be scaled to 4, the second to 8, the third to 12, and so on.
